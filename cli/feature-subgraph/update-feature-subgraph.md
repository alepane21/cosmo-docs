# Update Feature Subgraph

## Description

Update a feature subgraph within the specified (otherwise "default") namespace. A feature subgraph is an "override" of an existing subgraph.&#x20;

## Usage

The command to update the feature subgraph is the same as the subgraph.\
Please refer to [subgraph update](../subgraph/update.md).

{% hint style="info" %}
Feature subgraph labels cannot be changed. Feature subgraph labels are determined by the feature flag they compose.
{% endhint %}
